# Development Notes â€“ IoT Multimode Sensor Node

**June 6, 2025**  
Set up repo. ESP32 Wi-Fi/Lora switching logic outlined. Configured SHT31 and BH1750 sensors using I2C scanner. Reviewing InfluxDB schema for backend.

To Do Next:
- Build sensor read + deep sleep loop
- Write logic for RSSI + battery threshold switch
- Connect to TTN console + test LoRa uplink
